# Trombone

An overlay for studying adaptive dissemination of network state knowledge in structured P2P networks.
Trombone is a structured P2P overlay that provides a simple API to specify various network state maintenance
mechanisms based on the model described in the previous chapter. Trombone may be configured to mimic the fixed
maintenance strategies of existing overlays, such as Chord. Further, Trombone implements adaptive selection and
adaptive generation of network state dissemination strategies, as described in the previous chapter.

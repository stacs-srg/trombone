# Trombone

An overlay for studying adaptive dissemination of network state knowledge in structured P2P networks.
Trombone is a structured P2P overlay that provides a simple API to specify various network state maintenance
mechanisms. Trombone may be configured to mimic the fixed
maintenance strategies of existing overlays, such as Chord.

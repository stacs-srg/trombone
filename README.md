# Trombone

An overlay for studying adaptive dissemination of network state knowledge in structured P2P networks. 
Trombone is a structured P2P overlay that provides a simple API to specify various network state maintenance mechanisms. 
It can be configured to mimic the fixed maintenance strategies of existing overlays, such as Chord.
It offers various adaptive maintenance strategies based on genetic algorithms.
